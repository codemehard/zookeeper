# zookeeper
First Python Project from Hyperskill

This project allows you to see how the animals are doing in their habitats and asks you to switch the camera
from one habitat to another till you enter "exit".
It is built using Python basics: boolean logic, integer arithmetic, variables, comparisons, if statements, and while loops.
